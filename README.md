# GERMANY-CARS-FROM-2011-2021-ANALYSIS-AND-PREDICTIVE-MODEL-PROJECT

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
This study involves:

1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring uniform formatting.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding relationships between features like mileage, fuel type, and price distribution.

3. Model Development: Training and evaluating three regression models:
      
         a.Linear Regression
      
         b.Decision Tree Regressor
      
         c.Random Forest Regressor
      
The dataset includes features such as mileage, make, model, fuel type, transmission (gear), offer type, price, horsepower (hp), and year.<br/>
The goal is to determine which features most influence car prices and to develop an accurate, generalizable model for price prediction.<br/>
 1. It was observed that the top car maker in Germany between the years 2011 to 2021 was volkswagen, followed by opel, ford and others.<br/>
 2. Also, the top 3 years that most of the cars were produced are 2013, followed by 2016, and 2014.<br/>
 3. Again, the price of the car showed a positive correlation with the year and the horsepower whilst a negative correlation with the car's mileage.<br/>
4. It was also seen that, the top 3 models that was produced and patonised more was golf, corsa, and fiesta models.<br/>
##### 5. Buyers also bought more of the manual cars (71.6%) because of the average price of those vehicles compared to the automatic and the semi-automatic.<br/>
##### 6. It was also seen that, from the year 2011 - 2021, most germans patonised used cars the most because it was affordable and least expensive cars and most those cars used gasoline and diesel fuel types.<br/>
##### 7. In the year 2020, the automobile company in all make 75.9 million dollars and that was the highest sales made from 2011 - 2021<br/>
##### 8. It was aslo disscoverf that, the top three car markers that their avevrage car price seemed high was audi, followed by mercedes benz, and bmw.<br/>
##### 9. The top 3 features that tends to affect the cars price the most are:<br/>

######                        (a). the year of the car. newer cars tends to have higher prices.<br/>


######                        (b). the cars hoese power. Cars with high horse power tend to be sold at high prices.<br/>


######                        (c). the mileage fo the car. The higher the milage of the car, the lesser it price and vice versa.<br/>


##### 10. Finally , the best model to predict the car price was found to be random forest regressor having the accuracy of 94% and a mean squared error of 1962.71, which is less compared to the other models tested.<br/>
